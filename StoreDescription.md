Yowiki is a easy to use application that allows you to download Wikipedia articles to read offline. There are many times and places where you may not have internet access, and that should not stop you from learning. YoWiki enables this. You are able to search and download single articles or many articles that relate to a particular topic. 

You can download thousands of articles at a time and search your local library for anything you want to find. There is also functionality built into YoWiki to pick a random article for you from your local library so you can always learn about something new. 

YoWiki is also open source, so you can join in on the development to add features that you think would be the most useful.
